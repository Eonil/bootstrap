=========

This is a collection of initial configuration script.

- `objc2-fb9.sh`

  Construct Objective-C 2.0 environment on FreeBSD 9.2 using these components.
  
  - libobjc2 1.7
  - gnustep-base 1.24.5
  - clang 3.3.
  
  This contains these features.
  
  - C-blocks
  - ARC
  - Declared properties
  - GCD
  
  This script lacks support for these features.

  - GNUstep GUI
  - GNUstep SSL/TLS
  - GNUstep Web framework

  This is because I don't need them now. 
  If you want support for them investigate this site which has original script I referenced from.
